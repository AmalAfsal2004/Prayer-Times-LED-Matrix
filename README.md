# Islamic Prayer Times Display
Muslims have to peform five prayers each day, with the times of these prayers being determined by the position of the sun (or times of day). For example, there are prayers just at sunrise, noon, and sunset. However, because sunrise and sunset times are constantly changing due to the tilt of the Earth, it maybe difficult to keep track of the times of prayer. Luckily, mathmatical equations and astronomical data (not discovered by me) are being used to calculate the prayer times, and there are websites and applications that help Muslims determine when it is tiem to pray.
